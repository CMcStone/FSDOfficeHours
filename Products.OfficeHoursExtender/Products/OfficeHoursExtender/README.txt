Description
  
  You can add fields to the FacultyStaffDirectory content types by writing
  "extender" products. OfficeHoursExtender is an example one which
  adds a Mobile Phone field to Person objects (on the Contact Information tab).
  
  You can extrapolate from this example to make your own extenders:
  
  1. Make a copy of OfficeHoursExtender, and rename the folders to reflect the
     product name of your choice. For example, if you're writing a product to
     add a Favorite Color field to the Person type, you might call it
     FacultyStaffDirectoryFavoriteColor, call the egg
     Products.FacultyStaffDirectoryFavoriteColor and the folder inside the
     Products folder FacultyStaffDirectoryFavoriteColor. This naming convention
     makes your extender appear near FacultyStaffDirectory in alphabetical
     listings, making people more likely to find it.
  
  2. Replace all occurrences of "OfficeHoursExtender" in your new
     product with "FacultyStaffDirectoryFavoriteColor" (or whatever you called
     it).
  
  3. Customize the '_fields' list in the person.py file to add Favorite Color
     instead of Mobile Phone. Note that any fields you add must be of a type
     that subclasses 'ExtensionField'. See '_StringExtensionField' in person.py
     for an example.
  
  4. Test your extender. It should work at this point.
  
  Modifying Other Content Types
  
      To add fields to a content type other than Person, have your extender
      class (e.g. 'PersonExtender') adapt something other than 'IPerson' (and
      call them something else so as not to be misleading). For example, to
      extend Department, adapt 'IDepartment'. All the extensible interfaces are
      defined in FacultyStaffDirectory.interfaces. (You can also extend types
      that don't define an interface for you: just apply your own interface via
      ZCML. However, that's outside the scope of this document.)
  
  Showing Fields on View Templates
      
      In a future release, our view templates will be made out of viewlets,
      which you'll be able to replace piecemeal. Until then, you'll have to
      override the entire view template for whatever content type (or types) you
      extend. For example, if you add a field to Person, you'll need to include
      a person_view.pt with your product and do the usual skin registration
      dance upon product installation. OfficeHoursExtender doesn't
      demonstrate this at the moment, so the Mobile Phone field won't appear
      when viewing a Person, only when editing.

Installing the Example Extender

  1. Install FacultyStaffDirectory according to its README.txt.
  
  2. Place the OfficeHoursExtender folder in the Products folder, or use typical
     egg installation practice.
  
  3. Restart Zope.
  
  4. If you're using Plone 3 or later, go to your-plone-site &rarr; site setup
     &rarr; Add/Remove Products, and install OfficeHoursExtender.
    
Using the Example Extender
    
  1. In your Faculty/Staff Directory object, add a Person.
  
  2. Click the Person's Edit tab, and navigate to the Contact Information
     section. You should see a Mobile Phone field. Tada!

        * Added a bash script which helps to update news strings for translation for l10n.
    
        * Added egg packaging, since it's nice to declare a dependency on
          archetypes.schemaextender.
        
        * Renamed from FacultyStaffDirectoryExtender to OfficeHoursExtender to
          make it clearer that this is an example name and should be changed.
          Lots of people never renamed their products.
